# LogisticRegression

 Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

Logistic Regression is a mathematical model used in statistics to estimate (guess) the probability of an event occurring using some previous data. Logistic Regression works with binary data, where either the event happens (1) or the event does not happen (0).

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
